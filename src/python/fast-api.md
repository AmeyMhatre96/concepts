## Fast API Interview Questions

1. **What is FastAPI?**
   FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints. It is based on standard Python type hints, which makes it easy to use and learn. It is built on top of Starlette for the web parts and Pydantic for the data parts.

2. **What are the features of FastAPI?**

    - Fast: Very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic).
    - Fast to code: Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%. *
    - Fewer bugs: Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors. *
    - Intuitive: Great editor support. Completion everywhere. Less time debugging.
    - Easy: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.
    - Short: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration. Fewer bugs.
    - Robust: Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation.
    - Standards-based: Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for APIs: OpenAPI and JSON Schema.

3. FastAPI vs Flask
    - **Performance**: FastAPI is faster than Flask because it is built on top of Starlette and Pydantic.
    - **Type hints**: FastAPI uses Python type hints to validate data, which makes it easier to use and learn.
    - **Automatic documentation**: FastAPI generates interactive API documentation automatically, which makes it easier to test and debug APIs.
    - **Security**: FastAPI has built-in security features, such as OAuth2 and JWT, which makes it easier to secure APIs.
    - **Asynchronous support**: FastAPI supports asynchronous programming out of the box, which makes it easier to build high-performance APIs.
